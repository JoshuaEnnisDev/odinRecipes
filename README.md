# odinRecipes

Still practicing git and reworking the odin project because I got stuck on some CSS in the intermediate section.
I started an entire new account and Github, it took me a while to figure out how to get rid of my old SSH key.
I messed up my bashrc file and lost my coloring, it took me some time to figure that out too.
I had a .git folder way high up in my directory and VS code was trying to sync 10K + changes so that was where my troubles all started.
But I think I am good now and I have learned a few things along the way.
